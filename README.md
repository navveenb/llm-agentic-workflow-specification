**Introduction**

This repository provides a specification and implementation guide for integrating different Large Language Models (LLMs) into agentic workflows. 
Agentic workflows involve autonomous agents that utilize various LLMs to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with each other or users. 
Standardizing these workflows enhances interoperability and efficiency but presents several challenges due to differences in LLM capabilities, APIs, data formats, and interaction protocols.
